# Qlik Agentic Skills

Reusable skills, plugins, and schemas that extend AI agents with Qlik-specific expertise — works across Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and 20+ other tools that support the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io).

---

## What are agent skills?

Agent skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and reference material that an AI agent loads on demand. Instead of repeating context in every conversation, you package your expertise once and let the agent discover and apply it automatically.

Think of a skill as an onboarding guide for a new hire — it tells the agent what to do, when to do it, and how to do it correctly for your specific environment. The [SKILL.md format](https://agentskills.io/specification) is an open standard, so a skill you write here works the same way in every compatible tool.

### Official folder

Skills owned by Qlik engineering. Enabled by default in Qlik's agent environments, with more skills coming.

### Community folder

Skills, Claude plugins and schemas contributed by Qlik customers, partners, and the developer community. Opt-in at the tenant level. Every community skill passes automated security scanning and a quality review before being merged.

### Plugins

Claude Code plugins that bundle multiple skills together with agents, hooks, slash commands, and MCP server configuration into a single installable unit. Richer experience for Claude Code users; the underlying skills remain cross-platform.

### Schemas

Shared JSON and YAML schema definitions for skill manifests, plugin configs, and Qlik API structures — used by both the CI validation pipeline and the `skills-ref` validator.

## Install skills

Skills are installed using the [`npx skills` CLI](https://skills.sh) — no setup required.

```bash
# Browse and install everything from this repo
npx skills add qlik-oss/agentic-skills

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add qlik-oss/agentic-skills --skill <skill-name>

# Install to a specific agent
npx skills add qlik-oss/agentic-skills --skill <skill-name> -a claude-code

# Install to all detected agents at once
npx skills add qlik-oss/agentic-skills --agent '*' --skill <skill-name>
```

The CLI automatically detects which AI tools you have installed and places skill files in the correct directory for each one.

### Manual installation

If you prefer to install manually, clone or copy the skill folder into your agent's skills directory:

| Agent | Project scope | Global scope |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| OpenAI Codex | `.agents/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| VS Code / Copilot | `.github/skills/` | — |
| JetBrains Junie | `.junie/skills/` | `~/.junie/skills/` |

### Claude Code plugin marketplace

Claude Code users can also install via the plugin system, which bundles skills with agents, MCP configuration, and slash commands:

```
/plugin install qlik-cloud-skills@qlik-cloud-skills
/plugin install qlik-cloud-community-skills@qlik-cloud-skills
```
